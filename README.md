# Hearthbits

A functional hearthstone audio-sending-bot. Because sometimes, gifs just aren't enough :)

To run the bot, install python 3 (I recommend via Anaconda) and use pip install python-telegram-bot to install required libraries.

**To-do's:**
- [x] Make a requirements.txt file
- [ ] Make it so card images are displayed in-line
- [ ] Try and fix audio so it'll play on iphone as well
